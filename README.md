# smart-attendance-system

## Clone the entire repo or smart attendance system app using ssh via
``` git clone git@github.com:fastweb-cm/smart-attendance-system.git ```

## Install dependencies for the terminal app and the central server app
``` make central-dev ```
``` make terminal-dev```
### This will install all frontend dependencies for the two apps and spin up the apps respectively.

## You can as well run either apps given all dependencies are already installed or without necessarily running npm install using the make commands below
``` make central-run ```
``` make terminal-run ```
